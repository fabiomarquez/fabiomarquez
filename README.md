Hi! My name is FÃ¡bio Marquez de Carvalho JÃºnior (_FÃ¡bio JÃºnior for short_) and nowadays I'm working as a **Data Engineer**. I love helping people with what I know how to do and I'm always trying to learn new things. This is the space where I center everything I've been studying and doing.   


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with **Microsoft Azure stack** (Data Factory, Databricks, Synapse, Power BI)  


You can check what I'm writing on my [blog](), where I talk about the data engineering space and another things like BI, life, the universe and everything else.  


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **AWS**  

ðŸ“š I'm currently reading [**Fundamentals of Data Engineering**](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Data-Engineering-Robust-Systems/dp/1098108302) by Joe Reis
